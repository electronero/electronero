**- "xAssets"**                      "xAssets are 'Electronero R&D experiments' consisting of alt-electronero, and/or DeFi strategies deployed to EVM compatible chains. Research & development, or maintenance, and support is limited to funding availability which varies depending on scope of work, topics of research, and development, profitability of the underlying strategy. Due to rapid development, limited community funding, and community interests among a variety of factors Electronero xAssets are subject to change without warning. Please exercise caution, and research the underlying cryptoasset before making any decisions. Remember, it is always a smart idea to read the smart contracts in full and request an audit on any DeFi project before entering or trading a crypto. Cryptocurrency is highly volatile, and it's not for everyone. Please be safe."
**- "Crystaleum"**                   "Layer-1 cryptonote native blockchain launched several years ago as a result of partnership with Electronero Network. Genesis block of Crystaleum from ETN, up to block 500k where a chain split of sidechain Goldnero, combined with the blockchain raw of Litenero, which inherits blocks from parent chain Electroneum, and makes use of the Monero source code base which follows privacy-centric cryptonote protocols. Crystaleum has been Interchained with an L2 compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine."

The amount of LP minted to _msgSender() is relevant to amount of the supply owned by the holder. How much of each asset the holder can withdraw varies based on quantity of cryptoassets[A], and cryptoassets[B]. LP is decentralized, adjusted autonomously, and synchronized on-chain during each transaction interacting with a particular pool."
**- "Yield Farming"**                "Yield farming is the DeFi strategy which involves staking crypto liquidity pairs. In order to generate yields from the farm, otherwise known as harvests or rewards which are processed generally in the form of additional cryptocurrency of another or the same project. Usually LP is required to stake at a yield farm which would reward another cryptoasset with each block that passes."
**- "Masterchef"**                   "A MasterChef is a smart contract that controls what a yield farm, and/or staking pool can do, and how."

Check out some of Electronero community research, and development projects. Have an idea? Contact us on Telegram for help starting your project https://t.me/cryptocurrencydevs. We're working on some interesting contracts for Electronero Network 2.0 including "xAssets" DeFi strategies and decentralized exchange listings. Track smart contracts through verified sources such as Etherscan, Polygonscan, BSCScan, or trustless charting utilities such as Bogged Finance, Dextools. Liquidity pools are popping up all the time on decentralized exchanges such as [Interswap.finance](https://Interswap.finance), [Pancakeswap.finance](https://Pancakeswap.finance) on Binance Smart Chain, and [DoDoEx.io](https://DoDoEx.io) on Binance Smart Chain. For Polygon deployments we like [QuickSwap.exchange](https://QuickSwap.exchange)

**Wrapped xMatic [WxMATIC]**: Community members along with Interchained upgraded the Wrapped BNB contract to 0.8.5 solidity, and deployed to Polygon mainnet. This experiment brought valuable resources in knowledge of understanding of wrapping native coins to tokens and vice-versa. This experience was amazing and brought us great results in our research. The WxMATIC public contract is on Polygon and it's a clone of WBNB, updated to solidity 0.8.5.

**Interswap**: [Interswap.finance](https://interswap.finance) a yield farm, and convenient decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain with liquidity powered by Pancakeswap.finance. This rewards project is a fun way to learn about DeFi and start earning rewards on the Binance Smart Chain. It taught us how liquidity pairs function, and proved decentralized finance could be very useful. The underlying core is mostly a fork of PancakeSwap, with higher rewards per block. PancakeSwap itself was a fork of Uniswap.

## Announcements

You can subscribe to [electronero announcements](https://t.me/etnxnews) to get critical announcements from Electronero core. The announcement list can be very helpful for knowing when software updates are needed, etc. 

## Introduction

Electronero is a private, secure, untraceable, decentralised digital currency. You are your bank, you control your funds, and nobody can trace your transfers unless you allow them to do so.

**Privacy:** Electronero uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to send and receive funds without your transactions being easily revealed on the blockchain (the ledger of transactions that everyone has). This ensures that your purchases, receipts, and all transfers remain absolutely private by default.

**Security:** Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network, every transaction on the network is cryptographically secured. Individual wallets have a 25 word mnemonic seed that is only displayed once, and can be written down to backup the wallet. Wallet files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are useless if stolen.

**Untraceability:** By taking advantage of ring signatures, a special property of a certain type of cryptography, Electronero is able to ensure that transactions are not only untraceable, but have an optional measure of ambiguity that ensures that transactions cannot easily be tied back to an individual user or computer.

## About this project

This is a modified core implementation of Monero/Electroneum. It is open source and completely free to use without restrictions, except for those specified in the license agreement below. There are no restrictions on anyone creating an alternative implementation of Monero that uses the protocol and network in a compatible manner.

As with many development projects, the repository on Github is considered to be the "staging" area for the latest changes. Before changes are merged into that branch on the main repository, they are tested by individual developers in their own branches, submitted as a pull request, and then subsequently tested by contributors who focus on testing and code reviews. That having been said, the repository should be carefully considered before using it in a production environment, unless there is a patch in the repository for a particular show-stopping issue you are experiencing. It is generally a better idea to use a tagged release for stability.

**Anyone is welcome to contribute to Electronero's codebase!** If you have a fix or code change, feel free to submit it as a pull request directly to the "master" branch. In cases where the change is relatively small or does not affect other parts of the codebase it may be merged in immediately by any one of the collaborators. On the other hand, if the change is particularly large or complex, it is expected that it will be discussed at length either well in advance of the pull request being submitted, or even directly on the pull request.

## License

See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Contributing

If you want to help out, join Electronero Network Core Contributors. <a href="https://t.me/electronero">Contact us on Telegram.</a></br>
See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for a set of guidelines.

## Scheduled software upgrades

Electronero utilizes a software upgrade (hard fork) mechanism to implement new features. This means that users of Electronero (end users and service providers) should run current versions and upgrade their software on a regular basis. The required software for these upgrades will be available prior to the scheduled date. Please check the repository prior to this date for the proper Electronero software version. 

## Release staging schedule and protocol

Approximately three months prior to a scheduled software upgrade, a branch from Master will be created with the new release version tag. Pull requests that address bugs should then be made to both Master and the new release branch. Pull requests that require extensive review and testing (generally, optimizations and new features) should *not* be made to the release branch. 

## Compiling Electronero from source

### Dependencies

The following table summarizes the tools and libraries required to build. A
few of the libraries are also included in this repository (marked as
"Vendored"). By default, the build uses the library installed on the system,
and ignores the vendored sources. However, if no library is found installed on
the system, then the vendored source will be built and used. The vendored
sources are also used for statically-linked builds because distribution
packages often include only shared library binaries (`.so`) but not static
library archives (`.a`).

[1] On Debian/Ubuntu `libgtest-dev` only includes sources and headers. You must
build the library binary manually. This can be done with the following command `sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev && cd /usr/src/gtest && sudo cmake . && sudo make`
Then:

* on Debian:
  `sudo mv libg* /usr/lib/`
* on Ubuntu:
  `sudo mv lib/libg* /usr/lib/`

[2] libnorm-dev is needed if your zmq library was built with libnorm, and not needed otherwise

Install all dependencies at once on Debian/Ubuntu:

### Cloning the repository

Clone recursively to pull-in needed submodule(s):

`$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/electronero/electronero`

If you already have a repo cloned, initialize and update:

`$ cd electronero && git submodule init && git submodule update && cd coins/electronero && git submodule init && git submodule update && make -j2 && cd ../electroneropulse && git submodule init && git submodule update && make -j2 && cd ../litenero && git submodule init && git submodule update && make -j2 && cd ../goldnero && git submodule init && git submodule update && make -j2 && cd ../crystaleum && git submodule init && git submodule update && make -j2`

*Note*: If there are submodule differences between branches, you may need 
to use ```git submodule sync && git submodule update``` after changing branches
to build successfully.

### Build instructions

Electronero uses the CMake build system and a top-level [Makefile](Makefile) that
invokes cmake commands as needed.

#### On Linux and OS X

* Install the dependencies
* Change to the root of the source code directory and build:

        `$ cd electronero && git submodule init && git submodule update && cd coins/electronero && git submodule init && git submodule update && make -j2 && cd ../electroneropulse && git submodule init && git submodule update && make -j2 && cd ../litenero && git submodule init && git submodule update && make -j2 && cd ../goldnero && git submodule init && git submodule update && make -j2 && cd ../crystaleum && git submodule init && git submodule update && make -j2`

    *Optional*: If your machine has several cores and enough memory, enable
    parallel build by running `make -j<number of threads>` instead of `make`. For
    this to be worthwhile, the machine should have one core and about 2GB of RAM
    available per thread.

    *Note*: If cmake can not find zmq.hpp file on OS X, installing `zmq.hpp` from
    https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq to `/usr/local/include` should fix that error.

* The resulting Electronero Network executables can be found in `build/release/bin` for each Electronero Network coin in `coins/` dir

* Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/electronero/build/release/bin"` to `.profile`
* Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/electroneropulse/build/release/bin"` to `.profile`
* Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/litenero/build/release/bin"` to `.profile`
* Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/goldnero/build/release/bin"` to `.profile`
* Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/crystaleum/build/release/bin"` to `.profile`

* Run Electronero `electronerod`
* Run Electronero Pulse `pulsed`
* Run Litenero `litenerod`
* Run Goldnero `goldnerod`
* Run Crystaleum `crystaleumd`

* **Optional**: build and run the test suite to verify the binaries:

        make release-test

    *NOTE*: `core_tests` test may take a few hours to complete.

* **Optional**: to build binaries suitable for debugging:

         make debug

* **Optional**: to build statically-linked binaries:

         make release-static

Dependencies need to be built with -fPIC. Static libraries usually aren't, so you may have to build them yourself with -fPIC. Refer to their documentation for how to build them.

* **Optional**: build documentation in `doc/html` (omit `HAVE_DOT=YES` if `graphviz` is not installed):

        HAVE_DOT=YES doxygen Doxyfile

#### On the Raspberry Pi

Tested on a Raspberry Pi Zero with a clean install of minimal Raspbian Stretch (2017-09-07 or later) from https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/. If you are using Raspian Jessie, [please see note in the following section](#note-for-raspbian-jessie-users).

* `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` to install all of the latest software

* Install the dependencies for Electronero from the 'Debian' column in the table above.

* Increase the system swap size:
```
	sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop  
	sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile  
	CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024  
	sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start  
```
* Clone electronero and checkout most recent release version:
```
        git clone https://github.com/electronero/electronero.git
```
* Build:
`$ cd electronero && git submodule init && git submodule update && cd coins/electronero && git submodule init && git submodule update && make -j2 && cd ../electroneropulse && git submodule init && git submodule update && make -j2 && cd ../litenero && git submodule init && git submodule update && make -j2 && cd ../goldnero && git submodule init && git submodule update && make -j2`

* Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/electronero/build/release/bin"` to `.profile`

* You may wish to reduce the size of the swap file after the build has finished, and delete the boost directory from your home directory

#### *Note for Raspbian Jessie users:*

If you are using the older Raspbian Jessie image, compiling Electronero is a bit more complicated. The version of Boost available in the Debian Jessie repositories is too old to use with Electronero, and thus you must compile a newer version yourself. The following explains the extra steps, and has been tested on a Raspberry Pi 2 with a clean install of minimal Raspbian Jessie.

* As before, `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade` to install all of the latest software, and increase the system swap size

```
	sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop  
	sudo nano /etc/dphys-swapfile  
	CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024  
	sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start  
```

* Then, install the dependencies for Electronero except `libunwind` and `libboost-all-dev`

* Install the latest version of boost (this may first require invoking `apt-get remove --purge libboost*` to remove a previous version if you're not using a clean install):
```
	cd  
	wget https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.64.0/boost_1_64_0.tar.bz2  
	tar xvfo boost_1_64_0.tar.bz2  
	cd boost_1_64_0  
	./bootstrap.sh  
	sudo ./b2  
```
```
	sudo ./bjam install
```

* From here, follow the [general Raspberry Pi instructions](#on-the-raspberry-pi) from the "Clone Electronero and checkout most recent release version" step.

#### On Windows:

Binaries for Windows are built on Windows using the MinGW toolchain within
[MSYS2 environment](http://msys2.github.io). The MSYS2 environment emulates a
POSIX system. The toolchain runs within the environment and *cross-compiles*
binaries that can run outside of the environment as a regular Windows
application.

**Preparing the build environment**

* Download and install the [MSYS2 installer](http://msys2.github.io), either the 64-bit or the 32-bit package, depending on your system.
* Open the MSYS shell via the `MSYS2 Shell` shortcut
* Update packages using pacman:  

        pacman -Syuu  

* Exit the MSYS shell using Alt+F4  
* Edit the properties for the `MSYS2 Shell` shortcut changing "msys2_shell.bat" to "msys2_shell.cmd -mingw64" for 64-bit builds or "msys2_shell.cmd -mingw32" for 32-bit builds
* Restart MSYS shell via modified shortcut and update packages again using pacman:  

        pacman -Syuu  


* Install dependencies:

    To build for 64-bit Windows:

        pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain make mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-boost mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-x86_64-zeromq mingw-w64-x86_64-libsodium

    To build for 32-bit Windows:

        pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain make mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-i686-boost mingw-w64-i686-openssl mingw-w64-i686-zeromq mingw-w64-i686-libsodium

* Open the MingW shell via `MinGW-w64-Win64 Shell` shortcut on 64-bit Windows
  or `MinGW-w64-Win64 Shell` shortcut on 32-bit Windows. Note that if you are
  running 64-bit Windows, you will have both 64-bit and 32-bit MinGW shells.

**Building**

* If you are on a 64-bit system, run:

        make release-static-win64

* If you are on a 32-bit system, run:

        make release-static-win32

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/bin`

### On OpenBSD:

#### OpenBSD < 6.2

This has been tested on OpenBSD 5.8.

You will need to add a few packages to your system. `pkg_add db cmake gcc gcc-libs g++ miniupnpc gtest`.

The doxygen and graphviz packages are optional and require the xbase set.

The Boost package has a bug that will prevent librpc.a from building correctly. In order to fix this, you will have to Build boost yourself from scratch. Follow the directions here (under "Building Boost"):
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-openbsd.md

You will have to add the serialization, date_time, and regex modules to Boost when building as they are needed by Electronero.

To build: `env CC=egcc CXX=eg++ CPP=ecpp DEVELOPER_LOCAL_TOOLS=1 BOOST_ROOT=/path/to/the/boost/you/built make release-static-64`

#### OpenBSD >= 6.2

You will need to add a few packages to your system. `pkg_add cmake miniupnpc zeromq libiconv`.

The doxygen and graphviz packages are optional and require the xbase set.


Build the Boost library using clang. This guide is derived from: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-openbsd.md

We assume you are compiling with a non-root user and you have `doas` enabled.

Note: do not use the boost package provided by OpenBSD, as we are installing boost to `/usr/local`.

```

Build cppzmq

Build the cppzmq bindings.

We assume you are compiling with a non-root user and you have `doas` enabled.

```
# Create cppzmq building directory
mkdir ~/cppzmq
cd ~/cppzmq

# Fetch cppzmq source
ftp -o cppzmq-4.2.3.tar.gz https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq/archive/v4.2.3.tar.gz

tar xfz cppzmq-4.2.3.tar.gz

# Start building cppzmq
cd cppzmq-4.2.3
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
doas make install
```

Build electronero: `env DEVELOPER_LOCAL_TOOLS=1 BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local make release-static`

### On Solaris:

The default Solaris linker can't be used, you have to install GNU ld, then run cmake manually with the path to your copy of GNU ld:

        mkdir -p build/release
        cd build/release
        cmake -DCMAKE_LINKER=/path/to/ld -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../..
        cd ../..

Then you can run make as usual.

### On Linux for Android (using docker):

        # Build image (select android64.Dockerfile for aarch64)
        cd utils/build_scripts/ && docker build -f android32.Dockerfile -t electronero-android .
        # Create container
        docker create -it --name electronero-android electronero-android bash
        # Get binaries
        docker cp electronero-android:/opt/android/electronero/build/release/bin .

### Building portable statically linked binaries

By default, in either dynamically or statically linked builds, binaries target the specific host processor on which the build happens and are not portable to other processors. Portable binaries can be built using the following targets:

* ```make release-static-linux-x86_64``` builds binaries on Linux on x86_64 portable across POSIX systems on x86_64 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-i686``` builds binaries on Linux on x86_64 or i686 portable across POSIX systems on i686 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv8``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv8 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv7``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv7 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv6``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv6 processors
* ```make release-static-win64``` builds binaries on 64-bit Windows portable across 64-bit Windows systems
* ```make release-static-win32``` builds binaries on 64-bit or 32-bit Windows portable across 32-bit Windows systems

## Running electronerod

The build places the binary in `bin/` sub-directory within the build directory
from which cmake was invoked (repository root by default). To run in
foreground:

    ./bin/electronero

To list all available options, run `./bin/electronerod --help`.  Options can be
specified either on the command line or in a configuration file passed by the
`--config-file` argument.  To specify an option in the configuration file, add
a line with the syntax `argumentname=value`, where `argumentname` is the name
of the argument without the leading dashes, for example `log-level=1`.

To run in background:

    ./bin/electronerod --log-file electronerod.log

To run as a systemd service, copy
[electronerod.service](utils/systemd/electronerod.service) to `/etc/systemd/system/` and
[electronerod.conf](utils/conf/electronerod.conf) to `/etc/`. The [example
service](utils/systemd/electronerod.service) assumes that the user `electronero` exists
and its home is the data directory specified in the [example
config](utils/conf/electronerod.conf).

If you're on Mac, you may need to add the `--max-concurrency 1` option to
electronero-wallet-cli, and possibly electronerod, if you get crashes refreshing.
